The class is taught in a flipped environment using some ideas from Inquiry Based Learning:

1. All of the content is readily available (including video of every concept).
2. Contact time will be directed by students who have attempted questions on the problem sheets.
3. This is done in groups with students not only presenting their approaches to problems but also validating the approaches of others.
