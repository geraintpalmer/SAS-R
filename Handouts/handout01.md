# Computing for mathematics handout 1 - What you need to know

Lecturer: Vince Knight

Office: M1.25

email: knightva@cf.ac.uk

**Office hours: Thursday 1300-1500**

## Intended learning outcomes for this module:

- Understand and be able to write in Python the following programming ideas: Conditional Statements; Flow Control; Data Structures; Recurrence, Basic ideas of Object Orientated Programming;
- Use the above and a Mathematics package (Sage) to tackle mathematical problems;
- Have a basic knowledge of LaTeX;
- Work in groups to tackle problems and convey solutions to those problems through presentation.

## How the material will be taught (first term):

- 2 lab sessions to do 1 lab sheet (**bring headphones!**);
- Need to complete 80% of 'TICKABLES';
- **YOU WILL NEED TO WORK OUTSIDE OF THE LABS TO HAVE SUFFICIENT TIME TO COMPLETE LAB SHEETS**
- Lecture on Thursday 1100;
- Office hours Thursday 1300 - 1500.

## What you should do next:

- Download and install Python on your own machine if you have one:
    - If you have a windows machine follow the instruction at [www.python.org/](http://www.python.org/)
    - If you have a linux machine or using Mac OS (both of these are 'nix' machines) then python is already installed.
- Start working on the first lab sheet.
- Organise a study group of 4 to 5 people to work together (I suggest finding people in your own tutor groups).
